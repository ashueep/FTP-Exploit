## FTP
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests, a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a client-server model to do this.

A typical FTP session operates using two channels:

	[*]A command (sometimes called the control) channel
	[*]A data channel. 

As their names imply, the command channel is used for transmitting commands as well as replies to those commands, while the data channel is used for transferring data.

FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a connection with the server, the server validates whatever login credentials are provided and then opens the session.

While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the server.
